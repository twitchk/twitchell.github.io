Statement of Purpose



My name is Twitchell Dompreh Addai, and I am a Mechanical Engineer with six years of experience in technical and maintenance roles. Throughout my career, I have cultivated a passion for understanding and improving mechanical systems, manufacturing processes, and production management. My interest in transportation systems and desire to contribute to the future of smart and sustainable infrastructure have led me to pursue an M.S. degree in Civil Engineering, with a focus on Transportation Engineering, at North Dakota State University.



The motivation to specialize in transportation engineering stems from the transformative potential of transportation systems to shape societies. Urbanization, population growth, and sustainability concerns are all increasing the demand for efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly transportation solutions. My background in Mechanical Engineering provides me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and technical skills and I am eager to expand my expertise into transportation-specific research areas. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of technology and infrastructure and how innovations like data science and machine learning can transform transportation management and operations.



My professional experience has equipped me with hands-on skills in engineering design, diagnostics, and repair, as well as an understanding of how complex systems function in real- world settings. I have gained extensive knowledge of technical tools, production processes, and safety measures. Additionally, my strong programming background, particularly in Python and MATLAB, which I have been using for over 10 years, has enabled me to approach problems with a data-driven perspective. This skill set aligns well with the research interests and projects led by Dr. Armstrong Aboah, whose innovative work on transportation data science, statistical modeling, and the use of machine learning models to solve large-scale transportation problems is deeply inspiring.



I am particularly excited about the potential to contribute to Dr. Armstrong Aboah’s research on cutting-edge solutions, including the BisonGuard project, which integrates UAVs, LiDAR, and AI for sustainable herd management. This project’s emphasis on using advanced technologies to provide real-time monitoring and culturally tailored insights resonates with my interest in applying emerging technologies to real world problems. I am confident that my skills in mechanical engineering, data science, and hands-on technical experience will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the project. 
In the long term, I aspire to work on the design and implementation of smart transportation systems that incorporate automation, data analytics, and sustainability principles to improve mobility and reduce environmental impact. The M.S. program at North Dakota State University will provide me with the advanced knowledge and research opportunities needed to achieve these goals. With the guidance of experienced faculty members and access to state-of-the-art resources, I am confident that this program will enable me to contribute to the next generation of transportation solutions and various research projects.



Upon completing my graduate studies, I aim to work as a transportation engineer focused on integrating cutting-edge technologies into real-world infrastructure projects. My ultimate goal is to help create transportation systems that are efficient, safe, smart and sustainable.



Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to join North Dakota
State University and contribute to its vibrant research community.



Sincerely,
